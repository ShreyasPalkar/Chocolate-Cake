Bake for approximately 40 minutes at 325°F (160°C) or until cooked when tested. Test by inserting a clean metal skewer into the centre of the cake and when the skewer is pulled out, it should be clean. If there is a sign of batter on the skewer, the cake is not fully cooked.
If the cake is still wet and/or moist when tested place back in the oven for another 5-10 minutes.
